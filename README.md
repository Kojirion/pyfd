# Python support for CFD

There's a number of calculations I often perform prior to a CFD calculation such as 
 * Colebrook-White friction factor check with single phase pipe
 * Calculation of turbulence intensities for BC specification
 * Wheeler moment inversion algorithm

## General

### Pressure drop

## Turbulence

### Turbulent BC

## PBE
### Wheeler's moment inversion

Also known as Modified Chebyshev algorithm (Gautschi 2004).
